                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Himanshu Chand Thakuri and I am a versatile athlete who excels in a wide range of sports, with a particular love for football and basketball. I am a seasoned competitor in 100m races and have yet to be defeated. My expertise extends beyond sports to the realm of technology, where I am proficient in coding using Java, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have dedicated myself to physical fitness for the past 10 months, and my strength training has resulted in a deadlift of 150kg, a bench press of 75kg, and a squat of 120kg.</p>
